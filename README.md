Numerical Methods to Solve Eigenvalue Problem of Discretized Neutron Transport Equation

This is the code and data used in the paper "Numerical Methods to Solve Eigenvalue Problem of Discretized Neutron Transport Equation" by Grace Cummings, Michael Vander Wal, and Ben Whewell. For continuity, the paper as well as the derivation for the neutron transport equation are included as PDF files.
